# User interactions using markdown extensions

## Insperation

John Gruber's markdown.

## Impetus

I wanted a single place where my system I could just run 
a single app to configure whatever the hell I wanted to configure,
no matter how complex the resulting configuration, and to do it
in a friendly, smart and graceful way. 

So for instance if you only have access to a serial terminal the UI should
become a smart REPL app.

If you want to run it on a more advanced (say a vt100) terminal it should 
become a curses app.

If I want to run it remotely over the web, it should be able to do that
